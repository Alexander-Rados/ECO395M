# ECO 395M: Data Mining and Statistical Learning  

## Course details

* Instructor: James Scott (james.scott@mccombs.utexas.edu)
* Office: GDC 7.516  
* Course website: http://www.github.com/jgscott/ECO395M/

## Overview

This is a master's level course on data mining and statistical learning for students in the MS program in Economics at UT-Austin.  The course is intended as an overview, rather than an in-depth treatment of any particular topic.  We will move fast and cover a lot, but we will focus on practical applications rather than theory.

[The course homepage](README.md) has a detailed outline of topics, together with topic-by-topic reading lists.

## Software

* Statistical computing: [R](http://www.r-project.org), which we will use via [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), a free, platform-independent graphical front-end for R.  Make sure you have both installed, along with the [RMarkdown package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).  
* Other software: please [install Git and create a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).  You will use GitHub for version control and to submit your assignments.  


## Grading  

Your grade for this course will come from:  
- 70% homework.  I will assign regular homework assignments throughout the semester, which mainly consist of analyzing some data, creating a fully reproducible report using RMarkdown, and submitting your report through GitHub.   
- 30% final project, which will be like a bigger, more complex version of your homework problems.  I will offer a "default" final project, but you will also have the option of bringing your own data set and working on a project of your own choosing.  

## Readings

The course readings involve a compilation of free, high-quality sources.  

* _ISL_: Selections from _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.  The book is [freely available here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  I'll refer to it as "ISL" in the course outline.  
* _Elements_: selections from [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  A standard reference on data mining from a more statistical perspective.  Referrered to as "Elements" in the course outline.  
* _Shalizi_: selections from [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), by Cosma Shalizi.  Another textbook whose author has kindly posted a free version on the web.  Referred to as "Shalizi" in the course outline.
