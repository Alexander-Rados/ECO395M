# ECO 395M: Data Mining and Statistical Learning

Welcome to ECO 395M, a course on data mining and statistical learning for students in the Master's program in Economics at UT-Austin.  All course materials can be found through this GitHub page.  Please see the [course syllabus](syllabus.md) for links and descriptions of the readings mentioned below.


## Exercises

I will post the exercises [here](exercises/) and will call attention to their due dates in the week-by-week outline below.   

## Week-by-week running outline 

Every week I will update this outline to reflect what we're currently working on, as well as to give you a preview of what's coming.  


### Week 1: the data scientist's toolbox

[Slides here.](http://rpubs.com/jgscott/intro_ECO395M) 

Topics: Good data-curation and data-analysis practices; R; Markdown and RMarkdown; the importance of replicable analyses; version control with Git and Github.

The first thing to do is to install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  Detailed instructions for installing these two programs [can be found here](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_R.md).  Both are free.

R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.   I will use RStudio in class most days this semester, and you will use it most weeks for your homework.  RStudio depends upon having R available behind the scenes, so make sure you install both, even though you won't need to interact directly with R.  

Please install these on your own computer; you'll need them for the second day of class.  At some point before class next week, complete the following R walkthroughs if you need an R refresher.  If you're comfortable with R, you can safely skip these.   
- [Getting started with R.](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/heights/heights.md)   
- [Installing a library in R.](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_library.md)

Looking ahead to next week: data visualization.  The following software walkthroughs will help you get your feet wet -- a lot of this will probably be a reminder!    

- [Survival on the Titanic](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/titanic/titanic.md): summarizing variation in categorical variables  
- [City temperatures](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/citytemps/citytemps.md): measuring and visualizing dispersion in one numerical variable.  
- [Test scores and GPA for UT grads](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/sat/sat.md): association between numerical and categorical variables.
